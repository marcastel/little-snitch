[+DESCRIPTION?This command is used to convert flat files containind domain names, host names and IP addresses into the Little
Snitch RSS syntax. Its purpose is to facilitate the management and maintenance of such rule sets. The generated file(s) can then
be directly referenced in Little Snitch, either locally or over the net. This command should be invoked with one of three
keywords:]{
[+all?Build both the blacklist and the whitelist]
[+black?Build the blacklist (alternatively: \bblacklist\b)]
[+white?Build the whitelist (alternatively: \bwhitelist\b)]}
[+?\bNote\b that there are no security concerns in making this file available over the Internet. Furthermore, the URLs originating
from multiple sources, no Internet interests can be deducted; this is just noise for phishing and privacy invaders.]
