usage+="[+NAME?${rc.progname}"$' -- command line utility for the maintenance of Little Snitch rules.]
[+DESCRIPTION?Little Snitch is an essential security component on my laptops and workstations -- and probably a reason why I
resist adopting smartphones and tables, which are for me, the most unsecure platforms one could possibly imagine in a world of
pervasive tracking of all you online activities. While Little Snitch is a great piece of software and does its job nicely, it is a
real pain to manage and maintain you rules. This utility is here to assist in the management and maintenance of such rules.]
[+?The following commands are made available:]{
[+add-urls?Allows to interactively add URLs to the maintained lists. This is intended to simultaneously display the URL in a
browser window and provide a command line prompt on what action should be undertaken with the displayed URL.]
[build-rss?Concatenantes rules and constructs the Little Snitch RSS ruleset. This command is typically called periodically from a
scheduler to make all updates available.]
}
[+?I would have liked to say that this utility automates the handling or rules, unfortunately this is not fully the case because
\bObjective Development\b, the makers of Little Snitch, don\'t provide the conventional hooks for such automation. For security
reasons? Perhaps. Or perhaps not. In all cases, it is difficult to wrap scripts around Little Snitch. They have introduced their
RSS-like feature -- which is great, but at the same time they have encrypted their rules files, whose contents we could previously
list. Hopefully over time we will be able to extend this script and further its automated handling of rules.]'
