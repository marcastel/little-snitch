usage+="[+NAME?${rc.progname} ${rc.command}"$' -- interactively add URLs]
[+DESCRIPTION?This command intended to provide a semi-automated way of classifying URLs as white- or black-listed. The default
behaviour, when called without command line arguments, is to process the contents of the clipboard. Otherwise each provided
argument is assumed to be a file and will be parsed accordingly. Each parsed URL is loaded in your default Internet browser; the
browser application will be loaded in the background so that your terminal session doesn\'t lose its focus. The URL\'s name will
be displayed and a menu will allow you to mark the URL as black- or white-listed. You may also ignore the URL; the URL will be
automatically ignored if it has already been appended to any existing list. URLs are automatically dispatched in the appropriate
data file depending on whether we are considering domain names, host names or IP addresses -- only IPv4 addresses are currently
supported.]
[+?Unless the \b--flat\b option has been given, the input is expected to be one or more Little Snitch rules as obtained when
selecting rules in the \bLittle Snitch Configuration\b application and copying then to the clipboard. Each rule is defined as a
set of key/value pairs as shown below. Only the \bdestination\b key/value pair is retained and all others are discarded. If the
\b--flat\b option is given, then each input line is assumed to be a regular URL.][+\
